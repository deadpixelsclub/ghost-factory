# ghost-factory

Dead Pixels Club Ghost Factory is a Python program that selects images based on weights and combines them in a user-specified order.

## How To:
- Check if you have Python3 installed on your machine by starting up your terminal and running the command `python --version`.  If you see Python 3 or greater, then proceed.  If not, you'll need to install Python3 (you may have to Google how until I can update this README).
- Once you have Python3 installed, `git clone` this repo somewhere locally.
- Open the config.py file and set all your configuration (see comments in config.py).
- Open your terminal, navigate to your local copy of this repo, and run the command `python3 run.py`

If you run into any issues or have questions, feel free to open an issue in Github and we'll look into it.
